The Rise of Telemedicine in the Pandemic and its Impact on American Healthcare Access and Use

I collaborated with Melina Yang and Bela Burtch on this report and data analysis. We used the graphical user interface Anaconda, the Spyder IDE, and the Jupyter notebook IDE. This research explores telemedicine trends from 2019 to 2021, revealing an unexpected overall decline in usage and access, contrasting with a significant surge during the pandemic, especially among Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, underscoring the need for targeted improvements in telemedicine integration.
